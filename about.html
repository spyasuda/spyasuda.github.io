      <p><span itemprop="description">I am a trained librarian, archivist, cultural heritage specialist, and educator. I received
         my MLIS with a concentration in Cultural Heritage Informatics from Simmons University in May 2020. With my experience
         working in schools, libraries, archives and museums, I am passionate about education and service to the community.</span></p>

      <p><span itemprop="description">During my undergraduate studies at UCLA, I received the U.S. Department of State's Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship
        to travel to Pune, India where I conducted research on multilingual communities in the city.
        Graduating with a B.A. in Anthropology and a Minor in Global Studies, I was then accepted into the JET Program to work at a private school in
        Tokyo, Japan. There I worked as a translator, an interpreter and liason to overseas organizations, and an instructor.</span>

      <p><span itemprop="description">Now based in Boston, I am pursuing a career in the library and information science field. I currently work in acquisitions and cataloging at the
        Boston Architectural College Library. Passionate about equitable access to information and technology, I hope to work as a systems librarian and/or in
        digital preservation in the near future.</span>
