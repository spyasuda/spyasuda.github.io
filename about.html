      <p style:"min-width:1000px;"><span itemprop="description">I am a trained librarian, archivist, cultural heritage specialist, and educator. I received
         my MLIS with a concentration in Cultural Heritage Informatics from Simmons University in May 2020. With my experience
         working in schools, libraries, archives, and museums, I am passionate about education and service to the community.</span></p>

      <p><span itemprop="description">During my undergraduate studies at UCLA, I received the U.S. Department of State's Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship
        to travel to Pune, India where I conducted research on multilingual communities in the city.
        Graduating with a B.A. in Anthropology and a Minor in Global Studies, I was then accepted into the JET Program to work at a private school in
        Tokyo, Japan. There I worked as a translator, liason to overseas organizations, and instructor. In addition to my work as a translator
       and educator, I was heavily involved with Hands On Tokyo as a Volunteer Coordinator. I coordinated and participated in events including visits to nursing homes, English workshops at local
      children's homes, and assisting runners with visual disabilities.</span>

      <p><span itemprop="description">Now based in Boston, I am pursuing a career in the library and information science field.
        I have worked in acquisitions and cataloging at the Boston Architectural College Library, creating MARC records for both physical and electronic resources. I currently
        work as a Project Archivist for Boston University, Wheelock College of Education and Human Development, where I am processing and digitizing an archival collection and building a
         website to showcase digitized materials for educators and researchers to access online. Passionate about equitable access to information and technology, I hope to work as a systems librarian and/or in
        digital preservation in the near future.</span>
