      <p><span itemprop="description">I am currently a library clerk at the Boston Architectural College and a MLIS candidate at
        Simmons College School of Library and Information Science (concentration in Cultural Heritage Informatics).
        With my experience working in the education field and abroad, I am passionate about equitable
        access to education and service to my community.</span></p>

      <p><span itemprop="description">During my undergraduate studies at UCLA, I received the U.S. Department of State's Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship
        to travel to Pune, India where I conducted research on multilingual communities in the city.
        Graduating with a B.A. in Anthropology and a Minor in Global Studies, I was then accepted into the JET Program to work as an
        assistant teacher and translator at a private school in Tokyo, Japan. There I worked as a translator, an interpreter and
        liason to overseas organizations, and an instructor. During my time in Japan, I also did freelance work as a translator and interpreter.</span>
      </p>

      <p><span itemprop="description">Now based in Boston, I am pursuing a career in the library and information science field. I currently works in acquisitions and catalogues at the
        Boston Architectural College. Passionate about equitable access to information and technology, I hope to work as a systems librarian and/or in
        digital preservation in the near future.</span>
