    <p>When she is not immersed in the library world, Sarah occupies her leisure time cooking her
      mother's Japanese recipes while listening to music. Some dishes she is proud of mastering include
      oyakodon, shabu shabu and myoga donburi, tonkatsu, and tempura. She loves researching farming techniques
      for her favorite vegetables and enjoys learning about different regional rice from East Asia. Nothing makes her happier than
      receiving a sack of rice for her birthday.
    </p>
    <p>Sarah is also an avid reader and writer, influenced by Japanese writers including Banana Yoshimoto and Kobo Abe. She also loves reading anything and everything
      about phenomenology, going through an exhaustive list of philosophers including Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jacques Derrida, and Roland Barthes.
      She runs her own blog, <a href="https://emptysignified.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">empty signified</a> where she frequently posts book reviews and short stories.
    </p>
    <p>Travelling is also an important part of her life and taking leisurely strolls through mundane streets on quiet afternoons
      is an activity she cannot live without. She has travelled to India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, and Japan, making sure to plan days where she could
      freely roam about the unfamiliar cities. Antiquarian bookstores and music shops are also a necessity in her everyday life. She is currently working on her
      own collection of all-time favorite books and dreaming about having her own farm.
